# Sandbox Level 3

## Description

This is my sandbox for everything I have learned in [Codex Academy](https://codex.academy/) Frontend Development Level 3.

I use it mostly for taking notes, testing code, and practice.

Created with HTML, JavaScript, SASS, CSS, Bootstrap.

Tried some Node.js
Used NPM to install and try modules such as to-camel-case, to-no-case, to-space-case, and webpack.
